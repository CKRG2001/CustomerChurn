# CustomerChurn
Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains code to build and evaluate machine learning models for predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. The code utilizes Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and XGBoost.

Key functionalities of the script:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Loads customer data from an Excel file using pandas.
Handles missing values and categorical features using appropriate techniques.
Performs feature engineering to create new informative features.
Model Training and Evaluation:
Splits data into training, validation, and test sets using stratified sampling.
Implements a machine learning pipeline for training, validating, and testing models.
Employs StratifiedKFold cross-validation to enhance model robustness.
Evaluates various classification algorithms using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
Identifies the best performing models based on validation and test set performance.

Output:

The script outputs performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC) for various classification models on the validation and test datasets.

Further Exploration:

Explore hyperparameter tuning for the best performing models.
Implement feature selection techniques to identify the most impactful features.
Visualize the relationships between features and churn using techniques like correlation heatmaps.
